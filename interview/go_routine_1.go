// üìå What is the expected output?
// Unpredictable.

// You might get:

// 0 if the read happens before the write.

// 1 if the write happens before the read.

// A crash with a runtime panic (like: fatal error: concurrent map read and map write), especially in later Go versions.

// ‚ùå What is the problem here?
// This code has a data race.

// ‚ùó Maps in Go are not safe for concurrent read and write access without synchronization.

// When you read from and write to a map concurrently, without synchronization (e.g., mutex, channel), the program exhibits undefined behavior.

// The Go runtime may crash your program intentionally to protect you from subtle bugs.

// ‚ùå Problem: Data Race
// Go's built-in map type is not thread-safe.

// In your code:

// One goroutine writes to the map.

// Another goroutine reads from the map.

// These two operations are not synchronized, so they may happen concurrently, causing a data race.

// This can lead to undefined behavior, including:

// Crashes with fatal error: concurrent map read and map write

// Inconsistent results
